# py_cellular_sand_simulation
<h3>Pygame project which simulates sand using a grid and cell-based logic.</h3>
<p>Made for fun.</p>
<p>The code is not perfect and runs quite slow on bigger grid sizes.</p>
<br>
<h3>Key binds</h3>
<div>
<p>R - Clear and randomize current cell configuration</p>
<p>C - Clear current cell configuration</p>
<p>Left Mouse Button - Create cell at mouse position</p>
</div>
<br>
<h5>You are free to use the code however you want.</h4>
